# TypeMerger
TypeMerger is a simple merging utility class for C# that will take two objects of any type and merge them into a single object. 
The new object is dynamically created and added to a dynamic assembly which is added to the current thread domain.

The code is based on the original TypeMerger class written by Mark Miller (http://www.developmentalmadness.com/).
